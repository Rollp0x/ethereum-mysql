## [3.0.1] - 2025-07-08

### ‚ú® API Ergonomics & Macro Improvements
- **New conversion methods for SqlU256:** Added `as_u8`, `as_u16`, `as_u32`, `as_u64`, `as_u128` methods for ergonomic and safe conversion to primitive types, returning `Result` on overflow.
- **Bidirectional comparison:** Now supports direct comparison between `SqlU256` and all unsigned primitives (`u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`) in both directions (`SqlU256 == u32` and `u32 == SqlU256`).
- **Macro renaming:** Renamed macro `sqltopic!` to `sqlhash!` for clarity and consistency, as both topic and transaction hashes are 32-byte hashes.
- **Macro convenience:** All macros (`sqladdress!`, `sqlhash!`, `sqlu256!`) now support compile-time checked, ergonomic constant creation for Ethereum types.
- **Docs & comments:** Improved documentation and usage examples for all macros and new APIs.
- **Internal cleanup:** Removed unnecessary or duplicate trait implementations, clarified type boundaries, and improved code comments.

### üõ†Ô∏è Other
- **No Default for SqlFixedBytes<32>:** Confirmed that hash types do not implement `Default`, avoiding meaningless zero values for hashes.
- **Version bump:** Crate version updated to 3.0.1.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-06-30

### üö® Breaking Changes & Major Refactor
- **String-based storage only:** All binary mode support and related feature flags have been removed. The crate now exclusively supports string (hex) storage for all Ethereum types in SQLx-compatible databases.
- **Simplified API:** All wrapper types (`SqlAddress`, `SqlU256`, `SqlFixedBytes`, `SqlBytes`) now only support string-based storage and SQLx integration. No more binary column support or feature flag complexity.
- **Type aliases for hashes:** `SqlHash` and `SqlTopicHash` are now exported as type aliases for `SqlFixedBytes<32>`, making common 32-byte hash usage more ergonomic and explicit.
- **Documentation overhaul:** README and crate docs rewritten in English, with a clear focus on string-based storage, type safety, and API ergonomics. All Chinese content removed.
- **Test coverage:** Added robust unit and integration tests for all supported types and all three major backends (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite), all using string storage.
- **Serde support:** Optional serde integration remains for all wrappers, behind the `serde` feature flag.
- **Versioning:** This release is not backward compatible with any previous version that used binary storage or feature flags for mode selection. Bump to 3.0.0 as a breaking change.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Migration Notes
- **All users must migrate database columns to string (hex) types** (e.g. `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`) for all Ethereum types. See README for recommended column types.
- **Remove all feature flags related to binary mode** from your `Cargo.toml` and build scripts.
- **Update imports:** Use `SqlHash`/`SqlTopicHash` for 32-byte hashes and topics.
- **See README for updated usage examples and migration guidance.**

### ‚ú® Other Improvements
- **Cleaner, minimal codebase:** All code and documentation now focus on real-world, type-safe, ergonomic, and string-based Ethereum type storage for SQLx.
- **Better onboarding:** Usage examples and documentation are now more concise and practical for new users.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-06-28

### ‚ú® Major New Features
- **Dual database column type support**: Now supports both binary (BINARY/VARBINARY/BYTEA) and string (VARCHAR/CHAR/TEXT) column types for `SqlAddress` and `SqlU256`, controlled by feature flags.
- **New mutually exclusive features**:
  - `sqlx`/`sqlx_binary`: Enables binary column support (recommended for new projects)
  - `sqlx_str`: Enables string column support (for legacy/multi-language DBs)
  - **Compile error if both enabled**: These features are now mutually exclusive to prevent trait conflicts and schema ambiguity.
- **Feature combos**: Added `sqlx_full` and `sqlx_str_full` for convenient all-in-one feature enabling.
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Updated README and crate docs to clearly explain feature usage, recommended column types, and best practices for each mode.
- **Test coverage**: Added/updated integration tests for both binary and string modes across SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
- **CI/automation**: Provided shell/CI scripts and guidance for testing all valid feature combinations.

### üõ†Ô∏è Improvements & Fixes
- **Error handling**: Improved error messages and trait gating for invalid feature combinations.
- **Examples**: All examples now work with both binary and string modes, with clear feature requirements in docs.
- **Internationalization**: All comments and test docs now in English for global accessibility.
- **Manifest cleanup**: Removed unused manifest keys and improved feature flag structure in `Cargo.toml`.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Migration Notes
- **No breaking changes** for users who follow the new feature flag guidance.
- **Users must choose either binary or string mode** for database integration; do not enable both at once.
- **See README for migration and best practice details.**

## [2.0.0] - 2025-06-27

### Breaking Changes
- Major refactor: SqlU256 and related types now use the ruint-style implementation for improved performance and compatibility.
- **Database schema change:**
  - The recommended database column type for `SqlAddress` is now `BINARY(20)` (MySQL/SQLite), `BYTEA` (Postgres), or an equivalent binary type. This ensures correct roundtrip and storage of Ethereum addresses.
  - If you previously used `TEXT` or other string types, you must migrate your schema and data to binary format.
- This release is not backward compatible with previous versions that stored addresses as text.

### Other
- Updated documentation and examples to reflect the new binary storage format and ruint-based implementation.
- Minimum required Rust version and dependency versions unchanged.
